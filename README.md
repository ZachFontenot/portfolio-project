# portfolio-project

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

I ended up using Vite, because I didn't like the default settings for Webpack
and Eslint and all that Jazz.

Running is still just
```
yarn
yarn dev
```

I probably have dumb stuff laying around taking up valuable SPACE.
I also probably could've use Vue to more effect, but c'est la vie.
