         <h2>My Whole Life</h2>
         <p>
           I live in Louisiana and I'm from Louisiana.
           I went to School of the Art Institute of Chicago for Undergrad.
           I studied Sound, Film, and Sculpture.
           Now, I am a Software Engineer at Revelry Labs in New Orleans.
         </p>

         <p>
           I have three courses left at BU, including this one. I am
           hoping to move to NYC after graduation. My partner was born
           and raised in Brooklyn and so we've got <i>connections.</i>
           We live in New Orleans now with our two cats. I work from home
           and generally spend <strong>too much</strong> time programming.
           She works as a Pre-K teacher at a private school here, but she
           is studying to be a Librarian.
