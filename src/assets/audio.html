	  In the summer of 2016, my friend Sebastian and I went on tour
	  around the US, mostly the Southern and Northeastern states. We
	  performed in houses, bars, theaters, and art galleries from New Orleans
	  to Chicago to New York City. I flew down to New Orleans from Chicago
	  so all I brought was my laptop. I used the software MaxMSP to process
	  recorded and synthesized sounds, while Sebastian's project mostly
	  consisted of tape loops and droning distorted guitar.

	  It was a good Summer.
